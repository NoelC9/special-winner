Vision. 
This is made to be an android app that encourages people to recycle. 
People will be able to make an account using their google account and password. 
the app will keep track of how much people recycle(TBT).

Using NFC and raspberry pi:
Creating a "smart" recycle bin that can count how many cans/ bottles are deposited. 
When final amount of cans is deposited, users can use their phones NFC to connect 
to the bin and get credit to their account.After transaction is complete, users can see their balance.

user data and history should be stored in a database. Database of preference is MySql. Each transaction 
should update the database and user information should eventually be secured.

Eventually want to have google maps api for users to be able to find nearest bin.
